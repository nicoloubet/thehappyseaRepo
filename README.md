## What i have learned
The most important thing i have taken away from this project was not on the technical side but to stay patient and through that i can persevere and over come any challenge i may face. I did faced numerous technical challenges as well during the course of this project. For example using Bootstrap 4 was quite a challenge for me because i had zero experince utilizing it. I stayed patient researched bootstrap and how i could use it to help butify my web applications front end. Not only did it help improve the UI it allowed me to try something completely new, challenge myself and persevere.
